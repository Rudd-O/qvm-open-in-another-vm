# Qubes: open URL / file in another qube

This is a very simple desktop file to let you associate certain URLs or file types so they will always launch in another VM.

This is based on https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/common-tasks/opening-urls-in-vms.md#configuring-srcvm .
